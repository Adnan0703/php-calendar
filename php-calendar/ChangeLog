php-calendar: php + mysql + xhtml 1.1 + CSS 2 [+ gettext]

Version 0.7:
	* added .php to .inc files
	* cleaned up the look a little,
	* modifying posts is fixed which may or may not have been broken in
	  0.6
	* changed from specifying table name to table prefix.  to update
	  you'll need to create the new table (ie phpc_events) then do an
	  insert select to copy over the old data
	* fixed gettext stuff, I think

Version 0.6 (6/18/02):
        * LOTS of code clean-ups.
        * moved to xhtml
        * dropped netscape 4 support
        * added configuration to start week on monday
        * separated out style sheets, css clean ups
        * UI clean-ups
        * multiple language support
        * option to change the calendar to 24h time

Version 0.5 (3/15/02):
	* remove some warnings
	* fixed up indentation
	* a number of minor style changes
	* disallow remote access to config, header and footer files in apache
	* added an install script
	* removed $REMOTE_USER support, because I'll be adding my own 
	  eventually, and I never used or tested the current one.
	* added checking to mysql, reloading modify and add pages doesn't give
	  the same entry many times.  deleting a non-existant item displays a 
	  failure 
	* added an update script for version 0.3 and below

Version 0.4 (2/20/2002):
	* fix am/pm issues with new time input
	* add duration to events
	* add event type for full day and questionable times
	* not compatible with old databases

Version 0.3 (02/15/2002):
	* fix to make links work properly in IE
	* minor color tweak
	* bugfixes (thanks to richard@datafordummies.com)
	* more fixes for Netscape 4
	* made time input more user-friendly and fixed bugs with the old 
	method.
	* got rid of ugly old method of dealing with end dates and also found 
	and squashed a bug relating to that

Version 0.2 (02/14/2002):
	* allows color changing through variables in config.php
	* bug that caused header/title on pages besides index fixed
	* bug that caused modified elements to be added twice fixed
	* now regresses well in Netscape 4 (switches to HTML 4 transitional 
	for old browsers)

Version 0.1 (02/11/2002):
	* moved to php4, if anyone finds a version of php4 that doesn't work, 
          or finds this to work in a older version, please let me know
	* lots of style and HTML changes to try to make the calendar look more 
	professional.  I've tried to make the style sheet somewhat friendly.  
	If someone makes changes and wants a different style sheet included as 
	well, send it to me.  this is all initial work and the changes are too 
	many to include.  I decided to move to HTML 4.01/CSS2.  Only browsers 
	which fully support these will display the calendar perfectly.  I 
	tested using Mozilla, and that currently displays the calendar how I 
	intended.  IE 5.5 and 6.0 don't support the CSS element 
	border-spacing, so they look a little funny.  Netscape 4.x looks 
	awful, but is still usable.
	* there was a bug where if you didn't include a subject, the post
          wouldn't show.
	* included timestamp on the table
	* added variables to change the displayed title and the header.
	* some code cleanups.

Changes copied from original CST-Calendar CHANGES file:
        * Made the system 'authentication aware'. If you've got some sort of 
        authentication module that causes
        $REMOTE_USER to be set (as all of them do), the only username you can 
        delete/modify/add with is whatever
        you logged in as. Some sort of super-user might be added some day. If 
        you don't have an authentication
        method, you just get to change whatever you like.
        * A few usability enhancements. If something goes wrong in the 
        add/modify/delete stage, you're always
        given a button to return to the calendar (no pressing back and getting 
        POST missing messages).

        * Bug fixes relating the mysql_select_db function, which was hardcoded 
        to select database 'calendar' before,
        instead of being nice and using $mysql_database.

        * Bug fix for some browsers where setting a <td bgcolor=xxx> flag 
        caused the rest of the row to default to that
          colour, resulting in the calendar not greying out past days properly.
