add support for real users - started
unbreak gettext
thoroughly test the install, make it more robust
write page to create new admins, etc.
merge action=main and action=display
ability to display the next N events or events within a certain range.
 - display=year show given year or current year
 - display=month display given or current month
 - display=day act like current display
 - display=# display the next # valid ids, if id is given, then from there,
      else from the given or current day.
 - on no display - if there's an id or multiple id's show those, otherwise show
     the month of the given or current date.
make recurring events more powerful

later:
switch to phpBB sessions (maybe)
abstract things out better to allow for theming, etc. maybe.
add an interface to pick a color for each event
add a full year view. days with events should be a different color. full day events should be another color.
