add support for real users - started
thoroughly test the install, make it more robust
ability to display the next N events or events within a certain range.
enhancements to display:
  half - if id is given, show that id, if next is set, show $next id's
  done - if day is given, show that day
  done - if month is given, show that month
  not  - if year is given, show that year
  done - if nothing is given show the current year
make recurring events more powerful
display range of time in month view rather than just start time
integrate email_events.php

later:
abstract things out better to allow for theming, etc. maybe.
add an interface to pick a color for each event
add a full year view. days with events should be a different color. full day events should be another color.
