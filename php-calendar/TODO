clean up single event display.
decide if description should be show in multi-event display
add support for real users.
unbreak gettext
abstract things out better to allow for theming, etc. maybe.
switch to phpBB sessions

later:
add an interface to pick a color for each event
add a full year view. days with events should be a different color. full day events should be another color.
