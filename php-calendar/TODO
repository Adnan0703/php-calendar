add support for real users - started
unbreak gettext
thoroughly test the install, make it more robust
write page to create new admins, etc.
ability to display the next N events or events within a certain range.
make recurring events more powerful

later:
switch to phpBB sessions (maybe)
abstract things out better to allow for theming, etc. maybe.
add an interface to pick a color for each event
add a full year view. days with events should be a different color. full day events should be another color.
