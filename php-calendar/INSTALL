0 Preface
----------

The installation work arounds in this installation guide are based on the input
I have recevied from other users on different systems.  If you encounter
installation issues that are not mentioned here, PLEASE notify me at
sproctor@rottenvegetable.org.

---------------
1 Requirements
---------------

-PHP 4.1 or higher
-MySQL or PostgreSQL (or access to a server)
-ssh (try putty for windows http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
  or an FTP program which can utilize the CHMOD command (try smartFTP for 
  windows http://www.smartftp.com/)
-adodb 2.41 or greater

Recommended:
-editor (for editing the configuration files)

---------------
2 Installation
---------------

Instruction for people that are installing on a web host or some computer other than the one that they are working on are indicated with "remote host only"

0) Make sure php, an SQL server, and adodb are installed on your server.
   You can find php at http://php.net/ mysql at http://mysql.com
   postgresql at http://postgresql.org adodb at http://php.weblogs.com/adodb
   You will need php version 4.1 or greater. If you do not have adodb installed
   you can download it and extract it into the php-calendar directory.

1) extract the files from the archive
   (in linux: tar -zxf php-calendar-x.y.tar.gz)

2) (Remote server only) Use FTP to connect the server your webpage is stored on
   and create a new directory where you want to store the calendar (example:
   'calendar' for www.mydomain.com/calendar).  You can call it whatever you
   want.

3) Open up a browser window and navigate to the file install.php in your
   calendar folder of your webpage (example:
   http://www.mydomain.com/calendar/install.php)

4) Follow the directions given by the installer.

5) Once the calendar is installed, make sure to delete install.php or else
   someone else could run the script and over-write your calendar.

*** freak out if the above did not work ***

More seriously, if this didn't work, see the section below.

3 ERRORS
-----------

this section assumes you are using MySQL, but it may be helpful for everyone.

ERROR  db:1044: Access denied for user: 'MySQLusername@localhost'
--Make sure you have your MySQL username and password correct in the config.php file.  Contact your server to make sure they are right.

ERROR  create db:1044: Access denied for user: 'MySQLusername@localhost' to database
'MySQLdatabasename': CREATE TABLE phpc_events
--You may not have the abilty to create tables.  If not, try steps 7-11.

ERROR  Software error  Couldn't select database
--Make sure the name of you MySQL database is correct in the config.php file.  Contact your domain host if necessary.
--Make sure the SQL_PREFIX is set to 'phpc_' in the config.php file

---------
4 UPDATE
---------

PHP-Calendar is not yet stable software. I've changed the DB format quite a
bit through various versions. If you want to upgrade from an older version to
a newer version, please feel free to write a script to do this. If you do, I
would be happy to include it in future versions.

Good luck!
