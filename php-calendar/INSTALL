PHP-Calenar 0.7
---------------

Simple install:
tar -zxf php-calendar-VERSION.tar.gz
mv php-calendar-VERSION /path/to/html/php-calendar
cd /path/to/html/php-calendar
touch config.inc.php
chmod 666 config.inc.php
point web browser to /php-calendar/install.php
follow directions from there

Descriptive install:
Very easy install.  Put these files someplace in you web directory tree and 
either run install.php or add table.sql to you database (edit it to change the 
table name if you want and then also edit config.inc to reflect this change) 
and move config.inc-dist to config.inc and edit to setup your proper 
infomation.

You will need PHP 3.0.12 or greater, which you can find at www.php.net, and
MySQL, which you can find at www.mysql.com.  You will need register_globals
enabled in PHP.  If there's any other requirements, send me details.

update:
* Attention version 0.3 and below users *
Versions newer than 0.3 have a slightly updated database from the CST-Calendar 
DB and previous releases.  With version 0.5 I've added an update script.  
Simply run update.php to update your old database (you'll need to copy your old 
config.php to your new installation first).

Both the install and update scripts are messy, so don't expect too much from
them.

Good luck!
