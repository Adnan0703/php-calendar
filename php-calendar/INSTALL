----------
The installation work arounds in this installation guide are based on the input
I have recevied from other users on different systems.  If you encounter
installation issues that are not mentioned here, PLEASE notify me at
sproctor@ccs.neu.edu.

Once I have received more installation experiences, I will be able to modify the
installation procedure and instructions.



---------------
1 Requirements
---------------
-PHP 4.0 or higher
-MySQL or PostgreSQL
-ssh (try putty for windows http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
  or an FTP program which can utilize the CHMOD command (try smartFTP for 
  windows http://www.smartftp.com/)

Recommended:
-editor (for editing the configuration files)
-If you are running your own server you can download MySQL from www.mysql.com 
  and PHP from www.php.net and PostgreSQL from www.postgresql.org

---------------
2 Installation
---------------
Try the basic instructions first.  If that does not work, don't freak out, 
I have included some additional work arounds.

-----------------------
2.1 Basic Instructions
-----------------------

1) Unzip the program and save the files in a seperate directory on your computer.  You may need to modify some of the files if the first 6 steps don't work.

2) (Remote server only) Use FTP to connect the server your webpage is stored on and create a new directory where you want to store the calendar (example: 'calendar' for www.mydomain.com/calendar).  You can call it whatever you want.

3) Open up a browser window and navigate to the file install.php in your calendar folder of your webpage (example: www.mydomain.com/calendar/install.php)

4) Follow the directions given by the instaler.

***DON'T freak out if the above did not work***

---------------------
2.2 ADDITIONAL STEPS
---------------------
Try the following steps if the above did not work.

1) If you already have a database assigned to you, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to your MySQL administration utility and if you do not have a database assigned to you, you must create one.  Give it a simple name and write down the Database Name, User Name and User Password to use in the rest of the installation.

2) If you already have a database assigned to you, go to it and in MySQL run the queries in calendar.sql. (if you have shell on the server you can type: mysql -u username -p database < calendar.sql)

You might need to contact your domain host to obtain explicit instructions on adding new tables or databases.

3) Rename the config.php-dist to config.php

4) Open config.php with a text or HTML editor and edit the contents by
replacing the second field (ex. localhost) with the proper information (view
the file for descriptions of the items). If you made the change off of the server where the calendar is hosted, upload the file after you're done editing.

5) Try running your calendar by navigating to the directory where you installed it (eaxample: www.mydomain.com/calendar/).

***DON'T freeak out if you get errors***

You may recevie one of the following errors.  Try some of the following steps to remedy them.

-----------
2.3 ERRORS
-----------
ERROR  db:1044: Access denied for user: 'MySQLusername@localhost'
--Make sure you have your MySQL username and password correct in the config.inc.php file.  Contact your server to make sure they are right.

ERROR  create db:1044: Access denied for user: 'MySQLusername@localhost' to database
'MySQLdatabasename': CREATE TABLE phpc_events
--You may not have the abilty to create tables.  If not, try steps 7-11.

ERROR  Software error  Couldn't select database
--Make sure the name of you MySQL database is correct in the config.inc.php file.  Contact your domain host if necessary.
--Make sure the $sql_tableprefix is set to 'phpc_' in the config.inc.php file

---------
3 UPDATE
---------
Unless noted below, you should be able to make a backup of your config.inc.php, delete the directory that contains php-calendar, extract the new version, copy your config.inc.php into the new directory and move that into the place of the old one, and things should work.
If there are changes that require updating the DB, the last step should be visiting update.php or something like that.

version 0.7 and below:
from version 0.7 to 0.8, the config file format has changed.  please just edit
yours to look like the config.inc.php-dist included in 0.8 (or better yet, edit
the config.inc.php-dist to contain your changes and then move it to
confic.inc.php).

0.6 and below:
the table name was changed in 0.7.  you'll need to rename the table to something
that ends in "events" and then update the config file to have prefix contain
your prefix to that.  I should write an update script, but I haven't yet.  If
you write one or desperately need this, please contact me.

version 0.3 and below:
Versions newer than 0.3 have a slightly updated database from the CST-Calendar
DB and previous releases.  With version 0.5 I've added an update script.
Simply run update.php to update your old database (you'll need to copy your old
config.php to your new installation first).

Both the install and update scripts are messy, so don't expect too much from
them.

Good luck!
