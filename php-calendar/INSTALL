PHP-Calenar 0.8
-------------------

Simple install:
tar -zxf php-calendar-VERSION.tar.gz
mv php-calendar-VERSION /path/to/html/php-calendar
cd /path/to/html/php-calendar
touch config.inc
chmod 666 config.inc
point web browser to /php-calendar/install.php
follow directions from there

Descriptive install:
Extract the .tar.gz, and move it to the place you'd like your calendar to be in
your web hierarchy.  Either run install.php (by visiting the page in your
browser) or add table.sql to your database (
"mysql -u (username) -p (database) < table.sql" put your mysql user in for
(username) and the database in for (database) with no parentheses), and edit it
to change the table name if you want and then also move config.inc.php-dist to
config.inc.php and edit it to reflect this change and the rest of the information proper for your system.

You will need PHP 3.0.19 or greater (nothing lower has been tested.  3.0.12
should work but no guarantees.  if you succeed with something lower than 3.0.19,
please let me know), which you can find at www.php.net, and MySQL, which you
can find at www.mysql.com.

update:
* Attention version 0.3 and below users *
Versions newer than 0.3 have a slightly updated database from the CST-Calendar 
DB and previous releases.  With version 0.5 I've added an update script.  
Simply run update.php to update your old database (you'll need to copy your old 
config.php to your new installation first).

Both the install and update scripts are messy, so don't expect too much from
them.

Good luck!
