Very simple install.  Put these files someplace in you web directory tree, add 
table_format to you database (edit it to change the table name if you want and
then also edit config.php to reflect this change) and edit config.php to setup 
your proper infomation.

You will need PHP, which you can find at www.php.net, and MySQL, which you can find at www.mysql.com.

version 0.4 has a slightly updated database, shouldn't be hard to migrate, but
I'm not going to go through the effort to make a script yet.

Good luck!
