Very simple install.  Put these files someplace in you web directory tree and 
either run install.php or add table.sql to you database (edit it to change the 
table name if you want and then also edit config.php to reflect this change) 
and move config.php-dist to config.php and edit to setup your proper 
infomation.

You will need PHP, which you can find at www.php.net, and MySQL, which you can 
find at www.mysql.com.  You will need register_globals enabled in PHP.  If 
there's any other requirements, send me details.

Version 0.4 has a slightly updated database from the CST-Calendar DB and 
previous releases.  This shouldn't be hard to migrate, but I'm not going to go 
through the effort to make a script yet.  If you would like to or want it done,
please contact me.

Good luck!
