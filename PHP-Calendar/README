PHP-Calendar 0.5
----------------

This program requires a PHP enabled webserver and MySQL installed. Visit
install.php on your server of you can configure manually through the config.php
file and installing table.sql.  If you want to change the colors, currently
you must manually change the values in config.php.  I think the interface is
pretty much intuitive, use trial and error if you don't want to read through
the source.
