PHPCalendar: php + mysql + html 4 + CSS 2

Version 0.4 (2/20/2002):
	* fix am/pm issues with new time input
	* add duration to events
	* add event type for full day and questionable times
	* not compatible with old databases
	
Version 0.3 (02/15/2002):
	* fix to make links work properly in IE
	* minor color tweak
	* bugfixes (thanks to richard@datafordummies.com)
	* more fixes for Netscape 4
	* made time input more user-friendly and fixed bugs with the old method.
	* got rid of ugly old method of dealing with end dates and also found and squashed a bug relating to that

Version 0.2 (02/14/2002):
	* allows color changing through variables in config.php
	* bug that caused header/title on pages besides index fixed
	* bug that caused modified elements to be added twice fixed
	* now regresses well in Netscape 4 (switches to HTML 4 transitional 
	for old browsers)
	
Version 0.1 (02/11/2002):
	* moved to php4, if anyone finds a version of php4 
	that doesn't work, or finds this to work in a older 
	version, please let me know
	* lots of style and HTML changes to try to make 
	the calendar look more professional.  I've tried 
	to make the style sheet somewhat friendly.  If 
	someone makes changes and wants a different style 
	sheet included as well, send it to me.  this is all 
	initial work and the changes are too many to include.  
	I decided to move to HTML 4.01/CSS2.  Only browsers 
	which fully support these will display the calendar 
	perfectly.  I tested using Mozilla, and that 
	currently displays the calendar how I intended.  
	IE 5.5 and 6.0 don't support the CSS element 
	border-spacing, so they look a little funny.  
	Netscape 4.x looks awful, but is still usable.
	* there was a bug where if you didn't include a 
	subject, the post wouldn't show.
	* included timestamp on the table
	* added variables to change the displayed title and the header.
	* some code cleanups.
	
Changes copied from original CST-Calendar CHANGES file:

* Made the system 'authentication aware'. If you've got some sort of authentication module that causes
  $REMOTE_USER to be set (as all of them do), the only username you can delete/modify/add with is whatever
  you logged in as. Some sort of super-user might be added some day. If you don't have an authentication
  method, you just get to change whatever you like.

* A few usability enhancements. If something goes wrong in the add/modify/delete stage, you're always
  given a button to return to the calendar (no pressing back and getting POST missing messages).

* Bug fixes relating the mysql_select_db function, which was hardcoded to select database 'calendar' before,
  instead of being nice and using $mysql_database.

* Bug fix for some browsers where setting a <td bgcolor=xxx> flag caused the rest of the row to default to that
  colour, resulting in the calendar not greying out past days properly.
